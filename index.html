        <p class="lead mb-4">I have been in the fitness industry for 3 years now. I began my own fitness journey in 2016 and grew love for living a healthy life. I struggled to gain weight for many years until I realized that I was not putting enough effort. I slowly found the courage to step into a gym and give it a try. I changed my eating habits and slowly started seeing progress. After a few months I was finally gaining weight and seeing this progress only kept me more motivated to see what more I can accomplish in the future. After a year of hard work I gained my goal weight of 25-30lbs and then began incorporating weight lifting to build muscle and tone up. This was a difficult time for me because I did not know anything about weight lifting or how to set up a workout routine including it. I spent a whole year learning about form for every exercise and learning how to perfect it. Getting my body used to these movements it has never done took a lot of patience and dedication. It was a time of trial and error but I am grateful that I did this in my journey because i learned alot from other people around me at the gym and made new connections.<br><br>

        I hired a fitness trainer to help me out but unfortunately the experience he gave me was not all that great. The service he provided me with did not teach me new things which is what I hired him for. He just told me the exercises to do but never explained what the purpose of each exercise was and what muscle was the primary and secondary i was using. And after all of this, I thought every trainer would do the same thing so i did not bother to try another trainer.<br><br>

        Instead i kept teaching myself and proceeded with my journey. After two years i finally found the perfect workout routine that worked best for me and gave me the best results. I had a friend compliment my results and asked me if i could train with her and i said yes of course! She was completely new to the fitness world so she did not know a thing. I helped her by explaining the things that worked for me and what might work for her but it will take time. After a month of training together she started seeing great results and i asked if she changed her diet at all and she did not, she was getting those results just by training. I was very surprised because i did not know someone can get such fast results since it took me two years. And she told me “why dont you start training, you are a great person to train with” and that is when i found out that i truly love seeing her get results and seeing her happy living a healthier lifestyle. I studied right away for my personal training certification and took my test and passed. Ever since then i have been helping women better their health and lifestyle.
